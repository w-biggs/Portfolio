The owners needed a modern, easy to use website that got across the type of restaurant they are - one that's comfortable, homey, and casual, but still classy. In addition, they needed the site to be simple to update and take minimal upkeep. To fit these needs, the site is built on WordPress for easy updating, and has a modern yet comfortable look that fits the essence of what their restaurant is.",
