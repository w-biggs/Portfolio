    <h1 class="sans">Hi! I'm Wilson, a web designer and developer based in Philadelphia, PA.</h1>
    <p>Most of my work involves designing and building functional, beautiful, and robust websites for local artists and small businesses. This work requires a strong understanding of all facets of front-end web development; however, my strengths lie in <em>user experience</em>, <em>user interface</em>, and <em>mobile/responsive design</em>.</p>
