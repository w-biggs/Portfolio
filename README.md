# wilson biggs web design & development

#### [â˜› wilsonbiggs.com](https://wilsonbiggs.com)

This is the build configuration + code behind my portfolio website. Instead of a CMS, which would've been a bit overkill for this, I'm using the [Panini](https://github.com/zurb/panini) handlebars templating engine.

## Future plans / ideas
- Clean up the Sass code for style consistency
- Smoothly transition between pages with AJAX and CSS transitions
- Change the profile photo to a more recent one (I don't have any I like enough currently...)
