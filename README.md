# wilson biggs web design & development

#### [â˜› wilsonbiggs.com](https://wilsonbiggs.com)

This is the build configuration + code behind my portfolio website. I decided to build it without a CMS for speed and simplicity - and because I don't really need a CMS, since I know how to update the content within the code itself. In the future, I *may* split the content into a separate file and fetch it all with PHP.

## Future plans / ideas
- Split content into a separate file, fetch it with PHP
- Smoothly transition between pages with AJAX and CSS transitions
- Change the profile photo to a more recent one (I don't have any I like enough currently...)
